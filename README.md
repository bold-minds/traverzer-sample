# Traverzer Sample

## Description
This application uses JavaScript with ES5 language features to implement a todo application.


## Build Steps
A simple build script copies all necessary files to a `dist` folder.
It does not rely on compilers or transpilers and serves raw html, css and js files to the user.

```
npm run build
```

## Requirements
The only requirement is an installation of Node, to be able to install dependencies and run scripts to serve a local server.

```
* Node (min version: 18.13.0)
* NPM (min version: 8.19.3)
```

## Local Preview

```
terminal:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

browser:
1. http://localhost:7001/
```
